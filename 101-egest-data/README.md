# Egesting data from Veracity 

This templates show how to egest data from Veracity. If you do not have access to a data container in Veracity, we sugest you download the [101-developerStorage](https://github.com/veracity/veracity-quickstart-samples/tree/master/101-developer-storage-manager/developer_storage) and use that to create a emulated storage.
